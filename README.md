# Attendance-Marking-System-with-MTCNN-ArcFace
This project develops an automated attendance marking system using MTCNN for face detection and ArcFace for face recognition. 
Initially, frames are extracted from videos and annotated using MTCNN to detect faces. These annotated images are then used to train the ArcFace model for recognizing individuals. The trained ArcFace model is employed to identify detected faces from video frames, associating each face with a unique ID. The system automatically marks attendance by recognizing and labeling faces in real-time video streams, providing an efficient and accurate solution for attendance management.
